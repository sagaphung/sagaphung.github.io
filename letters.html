			<p>Hi SAM!!! Happy Birthday! Baby of our year. Can you believe you're turning 21 and graduating? TBT to Fall freshmen year when we rushed AXS and dropped it the semester after we pledged!!! The memory of you trying to ice skate still burns brightly in my mind :') Despite not really seeing each other the latter two years of college, we have quite a bit of memories!! I really miss those days when we suffered in 12A-- those mornings of rushing to class with you with your (missing) white hydroflask in hand. We've been thru a lot, and even though our paths have diverged hopefully we won't become strangers!! Pls stick around my life.</p>

			There’s not much to say. We ain’t that close so relax. Only memories I have are of games and your tinder adventures. But you’ve changed man. You were once shy, now you workout, dress nice, have a girlfriend, and succeeding in life. Wtf is wrong with you? You’re too old for me. We can’t be friends anymore, bye. Jk I love you . Happy Burfday boi. Help me get big 😩😫🥵🥴😘</p>

			<p> I hope you enjoy this website!! I'm sorry it doesn't look that great, I didn't have a lot of time to put it together + I'm sadly not a code master. I sent out a survey and stuff for your friends/fam to fill out and include pics and I just put it together. I just wanted to remind you that you're loved and appreciated bby. I'm really grateful to have you in my life, in all honesty, and I hope you know that. You've helped me understand what it means to be in a healthy relationship, and I know things have been a struggle but your compassion and patience with me really makes a difference. I love you a lot - I don't know if I'm in love with you necessarily, but I do know that I love you a lot and I want you in my life even if it's not romantic. You're always the first person I talk to and tell any news to, and when things are tough in my personal life you always know what to say. I appreciate everything you do, and who you are - you're extremely intelligent, thoughtful, and one of the sweetest (+ sassiest lmao) person(s) in my life, and I can't wait to meet your kitties, get food with you, watch Love Island, and everything else. Most of all - I'm eager to see you continue to grow into a more amazing person than you already are!! Happy birthday baby, I love you <3 </p>
